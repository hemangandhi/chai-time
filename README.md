This is the cutsy name the Mumbai Mirror uses for it's puzzles page.

Unlike most (the like 3) other newspapers I've seen, it has some really interesting puzzles.
So I've tried writing solvers!

The general organization of this repo is `puzzle/implementation language - framework/...`
with each implementation hopefully getting its own readme.

I might add some libraries in a `general` folder.

I might add z3 at the root level because coding up a few of the puzzles as an SMT query
is rather trivial and might serve as a good meme benchmark.
